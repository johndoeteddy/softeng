# TDD Part 3

Seeing your testing capabilities, a colleague comes by and asks for your assistance. He is required to achieve 100% line coverage on a project, but no matter how many tests he adds, he can't manage to reach that level of coverage.

His project involves simulating entities in an environment, which consists (among others) of [pandas](Panda.java) and [bamboos](Bamboo.java).

You are given the relevant classes. Write tests based on the comments describing what the methods do. **Do not modify** the code. Can you reach 100% line coverage? If not, can you fix the code to reach it ?
