## Sample Final Exam
#### `8-Dec-2017`

This exam comes from the `final-GASPAR` repo in the `sweng-epfl` GitHub organization. Please push your answers to this repo on the `master` branch. 

Grading will be done on a snapshot of this repository on GitHub (not on your machine). The snapshot will be taken at **`18:15 on 16-Dec-2016`**, and access to this repo will be terminated at that point (or earlier, if you leave the exam room). Please be careful not to overwrite your work, as we will only look at the final version. Commit and push your work often during the exam, to make sure you don't lose local changes and to mitigate the risk of GitHub going down shortly before the end of the exam. We use automated scripts to extract the answers from your repo, so follow the instructions exactly, and do not place stray characters in the files you push. We will provide Jenkins during the exam, so that you can get external validation that your code compiles correctly, that your test coverage is what you expect it to be, etc.

Exam rules:
- Use your own laptop to do the work; the laptop must be physically with you (i.e., no remote connection to your home PC).
- The exam is open-book, so you can consult any resource during the exam (website, class material, Stackoverflow, etc.) but you are not permitted to copy code from any such resource, and the resource must have been created prior to the start of the exam.
- You may use code that you or your team wrote for this class, or code from the lectures.
- You are not permitted to interact with or receive any assistance from any human being during the exam other than course staff. Both direct and indirect assistance is prohibited. Any use of Facebook, Email, Hangouts, IRC, Skype, SMS, phone, etc. will be automatically deemed to be cheating and will be treated accordingly.
- Please write down at the bottom of this file what external resources you used (URLs, written notes, etc.).
- Headphones, ear buds, etc. are not permitted; ear plugs for blocking out noise are OK.
- If you wish to leave early, you must show your CAMIPRO card to one of the course staff and await their confirmation that you can indeed depart; we will shut off access to the repo at that time.
- If you leave early without showing your CAMIPRO card to one of the staff, you will not receive any points for the exam.
- If you want to leave close to the end of the exam, the staff may ask you to remain seated, in order to avoid disturbing students who want to work until the end of the exam timeslot.
- If you need to use the bathroom during the exam, you must be escorted by a member of the staff. Leaving the room without an escort prior to you having turned in your exam will result in your exam grade being 0.

The exam is worth 100 points in total and has two parts. You have 180 minutes (3 hours) to complete both parts. Good luck!
