# CS305 – Software Engineering

## Final Exam

---

# Part 2: Theory [25 points]

This second part of the exam has 10 questions, with the number of points indicated next to each one.

This file is named `Theory.md`. Provide the answers in this file and commit the file to the `master` branch of this `final-GASPAR` repo.
Do not change the name of the file, and do not change the existing text unless the question statements asks you to do so.
We will only grade the `master` branch of your repo. Do not introduce extraneous spaces, as that will break our scripts and you will lose points.

The answer choices are provided as `[ ]`. You should change each one to `[y]` for each correct answer, or to `[n]` for each incorrect answer.
This requires that you replace the space between the brackets with either `y` or `n`.
Unless otherwise specified, questions may have zero, one, or more correct answer choices.
If you leave a checkbox empty, it means that you did not finish answering the corresponding question, so we will not grade that question and you will get 0 points for it.


## Questions

### Question 1 [2 points]

Which of the following variable names adhere to SwEng good practices for variable naming in Java?

- [ ] `String Name`
- [ ] `boolean NotAvailable`
- [ ] `int numberOfStudents`
- [ ] `int nunber`
- [ ] `List<Integer> examScores`
- [ ] `long q`


### Question 2 [2 points]

You have worked for five weeks on a Scrum-managed project in 1-week long sprints.
After these five sprints, you realize you need to refactor a big portion of your code due to unforeseen complications with your initial database design.
Within the Scrum framework, how would a competent Scrum master communicate the situation to the Product Owner?

- [ ] "We need to refactor because our database design does not comply with best practices."
- [ ] "If we refactor now, future features using the database will take 50% less time to implement."
- [ ] "If we don't refactor now, some required features will be impossible to implement."
- [ ] "The development team doesn't remember what the code does anymore."


### Question 3 [2 points]

In Scrum, who estimates the amount of time it takes to implement a user story? (only one correct answer)

- [ ] The Scrum Master
- [ ] The Development Team
- [ ] The Product Owner
- [ ] George Candea


### Question 4 [2 points]

Which of the following constitute code smells?

- [ ] Code that has not been merged properly into the `master` branch.
- [ ] Code that breaks the build.
- [ ] Identical code that exists in multiple locations in the codebase.
- [ ] A class that uses exclusively another class' methods.


### Question 5 [2 points]

When you start a new project, which coding convention should you use? (only one correct answer)

- [ ] Google's coding convention, because it's tried and true.
- [ ] You don't have to decide right at the beginning on a coding convention.
- [ ] You should agree beforehand, as a team, what coding convention you will adopt.
- [ ] Each team member should write code using their preferred convention.


### Question 6 [2 points]

Why is Waterfall not recommended for most new software projects?

- [ ] Designing code is harder because there are too many requirements.
- [ ] Validating requirements is harder because clients are not involved in the process.
- [ ] Writing code is harder because the team has to settle on technologies at the beginning.
- [ ] Fixing bugs is harder because testing comes only after implementation is fully done.


### Question 7 [3 points]

If the `Fondue` class inherits from the `Meal` class, is a `List<Fondue>` a `List<Meal>`? (there is only one correct answer)

- [ ] Yes.
- [ ] No, because its `get` method returns a `Fondue` instead of a `Meal`.
- [ ] No, because its `add` method requires a `Fondue` instead of a `Meal`.
- [ ] No, because its internal representation is different.


### Question 8 [3 points]

One of your colleagues decided to refactor a code smell, and transformed the following code

```java
public static int getMostValuableMemberId(List<Member> members) {
  int result = 0;
  int value = 0;
  int min = 0;
  for (Member m : members) {
    for (Transaction t : member.transactions) {
      value -= t.value;
    }
    if (min < value) {
      continue;
    } else {
      min = value;
      result = m.id;
    }
    value = 0;
  }
  return result;
}
```

into the following better version:

```java
public static int getMostValuableMemberId(List<Member> members) {
  int resultId = 0;
  int currentMax = 0;
  for (Member m : members) {
    int sum = sumTransactions(member);
      if (currentMax < sum) {
        currentMax = sum;
        resultId = member.id;
      }
    }
  }
  return resultId;
}

private static int sumTransactions(Member member) {
  int sum = 0;
  for (Transaction transaction : member.transactions) {
    sum = sum + transaction.value;
  }
  return sum;
}
```

Indicate below which refactoring technique(s) your colleague used?

- [ ] Inline method
- [ ] Extract class
- [ ] Extract method
- [ ] Substitute algorithm


### Question 9 [3 points]

Below are multiple code snippets annotated with preconditions, postconditions, and/or invariants in the CoFoJa framework mentioned in the lectures. Indicate which snippet(s) is/are valid and accomplish(es) both of the following:

- the `score` field is never negative (assume there are no overflows) _and_
- the `points` that get added to `score` are always positive?

- [ ] Option 1

```java
@Invariant("score >= 0;")
public class ScoreKeeper {
   private int score = 0;

   @Requires("points > 0")
   public addPoints(int points) {
      this.score += points;
  }
}
```

- [ ] Option 2

```java
@Invariant("score >= 0;")
public class ScoreKeeper {
   private int score = 0;

   @Ensures("points > 0")
   public addPoints(int points) {
      this.score += points;
  }
}
```

- [ ] Option 3

```java
public class ScoreKeeper {
   private int score;

   public ScoreKeeper(int initialScore) {
      this.score = initialScore;
   }

   @Requires("points > 0")
   @Ensures("score > 0")
   public addPoints(int points) {
      this.score += points;
  }
}
```

- [ ] Option 4

```java
public class ScoreKeeper {
   private int score = 0;

   @Requires("points > 0")
   public addPoints(int points) {
      this.score += points;
  }
}
```


### Question 10 [4 points]

Given the following code:

```java
while(true) {
   int temperature = getTemperature();

   if (temperature < 0) {
      System.out.println("Let it snow!");

      if (temperature < -100) {
         System.out.println("...Whoa!");
     }
   }
}
```

Say you are tasked with writing tests for this code. What is the maximum path coverage you can hope to obtain?

- [ ] 0 ≤ path coverage < 1%
- [ ] 1% ≤ path coverage < 25%
- [ ] 25% ≤ path coverage < 50%
- [ ] 50% ≤ path coverage ≤ 100%
